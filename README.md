Copyright (C) 2018, Josh M <mcu@protonmail.com>  

Lexan is a command line GPG encryption manager that is written in Ruby.<br>
It was created to assist in navigating through GPG commands easily in the Linux terminal.

Install Ruby on your computer and run the program with the command:<br>
<b>$ ruby lexan.rb</b>

You need to install the Curses module for Ruby.<br>
This can usually be done with a command such as:

<b>$ apt-get install ruby-curses</b>

or 

<b>$ gem install curses</b>

or

<b>$ apt-get install curses</b>

Use these commands for Ubuntu 18.04:

<b>$ sudo apt-get install ruby`ruby -e 'puts RUBY_VERSION[/\d+\.\d+/]'`-dev</b><br>
<b>$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev</b><br>
<b>$ sudo gem install curses</b>
