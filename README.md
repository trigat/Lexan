Copyright (C) 2018, Josh M <mcu@protonmail.com>  

Lexan is a command line GPG encryption manager that is written in Ruby.
It was created to assist in navigating through GPG commands easily in the Linux terminal.

Install Ruby on your computer and run the program with the command:
$ ruby lexan.rb

You need to install the Curses module for Ruby.
This can usually be done with a command such as:

$ apt-get install ruby-curses

or 

$ gem install curses

or

$ apt-get install curses

Use these commands for Ubuntu 18.04:

sudo apt-get install ruby`ruby -e 'puts RUBY_VERSION[/\d+\.\d+/]'`-dev<br>
